##Canadian Rules Uno

- Each of these additional rules are in existence with the games original rules.
- Players must call out "six" or "nine" if playing a 6 or 9. Failure to do so results in drawing two cards.
- If a player calls out any other number but 6 or 9, player must draw two cards.
- Players may play a card at anytime (i.e. out of turn) if that card matches the deck card in number.
- However, a player can only place one card with one deliberate arm movement at a time (i.e. can't place more than one card with one arm movement).
- If a player mistakenly places an incorrect card, player must draw two cards.
- "Draw two" cards may be stacked on top of one another when applicable, adding two with each additional card placed. (i.e. if two draw two cards are on top of one another, penalized player draws four cards.) Next in turn draws the total number of +X cards.
- Same rule applies with draw four cards.
- Game is best played with six or more players, and a double deck of cards.
