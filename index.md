### The Rules
- Each of these additional rules are to be used in combination with the game's original rules.
- Players must call out "six" or "nine" if playing a 6 or 9. Failure to do so results in drawing two cards.
- If a player calls out any other number but 6 or 9, player must draw two cards.
- Players may play a card at anytime (i.e. out of turn) if that card matches the deck card in number.
- However, a player can only place one card with one deliberate arm movement at a time (i.e. can't place more than one card with one arm movement).
- If a player mistakenly places an incorrect card, player must draw two cards.
- "Draw two" cards may be stacked on top of one another when applicable, adding two with each additional card placed. (i.e. if two draw two cards are on top of one another, penalized player draws four cards.) Next in turn draws the total number of +X cards.
- Same rule applies with draw four cards.
- Game is best played with six or more players.

### The History
The origins of Canadian Rules Uno can be traced back at least 400 years to a remote island off of Nova Scotia, and are deeply embedded in the history of card game development in early North America. This popular Uno variant traveled slowly through what is now the United States, and was heavily featured in card rooms throughout the American Wild West in the early 1900s. Rumor has it that famous outlaw “Laughing” Sam Carey met his untimely demise 1903 in a gunfight that started with an infamous draw 16. Eventually Canadian Rules Uno made it all the way to Mexico, where it’s still popular to this day among rock climbers and van dwellers.
